# Implementing-Logic-Gates-using-Neural-Networks

In this project, I have shown how implement logic gates using neural networks.

Logic gates form the basis of any complex calculations that we perform from addition to subtraction to integration and even derivation. Logic gates I have implemented in this project are OR, NOR, AND, NAND and XOR
